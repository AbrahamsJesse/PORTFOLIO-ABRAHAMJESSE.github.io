# Project Title: Exploring the Used Card Market

## Project Overview:

This SQL project aims to explore and analyze a dataset containing information on second-hand cars 
published across four different websites. The dataset comprises four tables with mostly common columns,
including attributes such as Brand, Model, Year, Color, Fuel Type, Original Price, Selling Type, 
Kilometers Driven, and Seller Type. Further details about the dataset can be found here.

We will employ a variety of SQL techniques to analyze different aspects of the car dataset, including 
pricing, market trends, performance, and ownership analysis. By answering business questions and uncovering
insights, we aim to provide valuable data for decision-making and strategic planning. These analyses can
benefit individual buyers interested in purchasing used cars, as well as car companies or dealers looking
to understand market trends and competitors.

## Sections of the Analysis:

-  Pricing Analysis: Analyzing average selling prices by brand, overall dataset, and variations based on the
    year of manufacture.
   
-  Market Trends: Identifying the most common seller of second-hand cars and determining the least likely
    cars to be sold.
   
-  Performance and Specifications: Utilizing joins, unions, and aggregations to analyze kilometers driven,
    common fuel types, and correlation between seating capacity and selling price.
   
-  Views and CTEs: Creating views and common table expressions (CTEs) for specific brands to facilitate analysis.
  
-  Ownership Analysis: Investigating pricing trends based on seller type and fuel type.
  
## Functions and Techniques Used:

Aggregate functions, LIKE, AS, IN, BETWEEN, TOP, GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, HAVING, EXISTS, AND, ASC/DESC, Views, CTEs, JOIN, UNION, Subquery.
