Project Title: Shark Attack Analysis

Introduction:

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about shark attacks worldwide. The primary objectives include data cleaning, formatting, and analysis to extract valuable insights regarding shark attacks. The project utilizes both Python and SQL for data manipulation and analysis.

Primary Objectives:

Importing Dataframe and Initial Analysis: Importing the dataset into a DataFrame, performing initial analysis, and identifying areas for data cleaning.
Handling Null Values: Identifying and handling null values in the dataset, including dropping irrelevant columns and rows.
Handling Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate rows from the dataset.
Business Case Specification: Defining the business case scenario and hypotheses to be tested using the dataset.
Data Formatting and Cleaning: Formatting and cleaning the dataset to prepare it for analysis, including standardizing data formats and categorizing data points.
Hypothesis Testing: Testing hypotheses related to shark attacks using the cleaned dataset.
Libraries and Imports Used:

-	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
-	Matplotlib: For data visualization.
-	Numpy: For numerical operations.
-	Re: For pattern matching and string manipulation.
-	Json_normalize: For flattening and normalizing JSON data.
-	Requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch data.
-	Mysql.connector: For interacting with MySQL databases.

Conclusion:

The project successfully achieved its objectives by performing comprehensive data cleaning, formatting, and analysis. Insights were extracted to test hypotheses related to shark attacks, providing valuable information for further research and decision-making.
