# Project title: Sales Overview in India - Dashboard

## Introduction:
This Tableau project provides an overview of sales trends and patterns in India. The project aims to analyze
sales data across different categories, sub-categories, states, and payment methods to derive valuable insights
into market dynamics and consumer behavior.

## Dashboard Overview:

-  Sold Quantity per Category:

In India, Electronic Products lead the market in terms of sold quantity, followed by Clothing. Furniture 
contributes as the third most popular category in terms of sales volume.

-  Profit per Sub-Category:

The most profitable products for each category are identified, with Electronic Printers, Furniture Bookcases, 
and Saree (a traditional clothing item) being the top performers in Electronic Products, Furniture, and Clothing
categories, respectively.

-  Number of Orders in the Country by State:

This chart provides insights into the distribution of orders across different states in India. Users can select 
specific states to observe the comparison of profit by state on the next chart.

-  Profit by State:

A horizontal bar chart displays a comparison of sales profitability across selected states in India. The states 
are arranged in decreasing order of profits, with profits represented on the horizontal axis. It's important to
note that some states may have negative profits.

-  Transactions by Payment Methods:

This chart highlights the distribution of transactions based on different payment methods. Cash on Delivery
(COD) emerges as the leading payment method, followed by Credit Card, with Equated Monthly Installment (EMI)
being the third most preferred payment option.

## Conclusion:
Through this Tableau project, a comprehensive understanding of sales dynamics in India is achieved. 
By analyzing sold quantity, profits, state-wise distribution, and payment methods, valuable insights 
are obtained, which can aid in strategic decision-making and optimizing sales strategies in the Indian market.
