# Tableau Project: Global Happiness Score and Antidepressants Use - Dashboards

## Introduction:

This Tableau project explores the global happiness score over multiple years and examines 
the usage of antidepressants in Scandinavian countries. The project aims to analyze trends,
patterns, and correlations between happiness levels and antidepressant usage.

## Data Preparation:

The project begins with data preparation in Python. Multiple datasets from the Global Happiness
Report for the years 2015 to 2023 are concatenated into one comprehensive dataset. Each dataset 
is augmented with a "year" column to indicate the corresponding year. The concatenated dataset 
is saved as "new_file.csv" for further analysis.


## Dashboard 1 (first tab): Global Happiness Score
Visualizations:

-  Happiness Evolution over the Years: Line chart showing the trend of happiness scores across 
    different years globally.
-  Happiness Score per Country: Bar chart displaying the happiness score for each country in the
    dataset.
-  Factors for Happiness Measure: Visual representation of the key factors contributing to the 
    happiness score.
-  Happiness Evolution Summary by Year and Region: Summary of happiness evolution categorized 
    by year and region.
-  Interactive Map: Geospatial visualization showing happiness scores on a world map.



## Dashboard 2 (second tab): Antidepressants Use in Scandinavian Countries
Visualizations:

-  Percentage of Antidepressants Users per Country: Pie chart illustrating the percentage of 
    antidepressant users in Scandinavian countries.
-  Average Age of Users Distributed by Gender: Histogram depicting the distribution of average 
    age of antidepressant users segmented by gender.
-  Use Evolution over the Years per Country: Line chart displaying the trend of antidepressant 
    usage over the years in Scandinavian countries.


## Conclusion:
This Tableau project provides valuable insights into the relationship between global happiness 
scores and antidepressant usage, with a specific focus on Scandinavian countries. By analyzing
trends and patterns, the project sheds light on the factors influencing happiness levels and the
prevalence of antidepressant usage in these countries.
